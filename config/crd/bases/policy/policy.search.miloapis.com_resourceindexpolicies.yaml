                  Conditions filter which resources are indexed.
                  CEL expressions that filter which resources are indexed. Multiple
                   conditions can be specified and are evaluated with OR semantics - a
                   resource is indexed if it satisfies ANY condition. Use && within a
                   single expression to require multiple criteria together.

                   Each condition has:
                   - name: A unique identifier for the condition, used in status reporting
                     and debugging to identify which condition(s) matched a resource.
                   - expression: A CEL expression that must evaluate to a boolean. The
                     resource is available as the root object in the expression context.

                   Available CEL operations:
                   - Field access: spec.replicas, metadata.name, status.phase
                   - Map access: metadata.labels["app"], metadata.annotations["key"]
                   - Comparisons: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
                   - Logical operators: &&, ||, !
                   - String functions: contains(), startsWith(), endsWith(), matches()
                   - List functions: exists(), all(), size(), map(), filter()
                   - Membership: "value" in list, "key" in map
                   - Ternary: condition ? trueValue : falseValue
